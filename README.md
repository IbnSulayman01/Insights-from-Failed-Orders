Insights from Failed Orders - Data Project Overview
This data project, sourced from StrataScratch, serves as a take-home assignment for data science roles at Gett, an Israeli-based corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM) platform. Focused on analyzing unsuccessful taxi orders—where customers don’t ultimately get a ride—the project explores matching metrics using two datasets: data_orders and data_offers. The goal is to uncover patterns in failed orders and provide actionable insights.
