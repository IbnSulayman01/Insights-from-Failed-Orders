Insights from Failed Orders - Data Project Overview
This data project, sourced from StrataScratch, serves as a take-home assignment for data science roles at Gett, an Israeli-based corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM) platform. Focused on analyzing unsuccessful taxi orders—where customers don’t ultimately get a ride—the project explores matching metrics using two datasets: data_orders and data_offers. The goal is to uncover patterns in failed orders and provide actionable insights.

Key Tasks:

**Failure Distribution:** Analyze why orders fail (e.g., cancellations before/after driver assignment, rejections) and identify the most common failure category.
**Hourly Trends**: Plot failed orders by hour to spot trends or peak failure times and hypothesize explanations.
**Cancellation Timing**: Examine average cancellation times (with/without a driver) by hour, addressing outliers for clearer insights.
**ETA Analysis**: Visualize average Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) by hour and interpret the results.
**Bonus (Hexagons)**: Use h3 and folium to map orders into size-8 hexagons, highlighting areas with 80% of orders and coloring by failure count.
